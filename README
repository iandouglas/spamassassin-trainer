You can run a "Build your own SpamAssassin Trainer Script" wizard
at http://iandouglas.com/spamassassin-trainer/
 
This script setup is meant for people who are on shared hosting
accounts with services who offer cPanel. Up until about late 2010,
cPanel didn't give you the means to train your own SpamAssassin
tokens for locally-hosted mailboxes, so I wrote a very simple
script that you can call from your cgi-bin folder which will scan
for your mailboxes and train SpamAssassin for you, which should
give you a *dramatic* reduction of spam in your inbox.

Full documentation can be found at the URL above if you want to
tweak the script yourself. There are also heavy amounts of
commenting in the Perl script itself.

I am available for support if you need assistance with the setup
of the script.


Configuration

There are only two things you need to change in the Perl script
and only one change in the user_prefs file.

In the CGI script, you will need to configure your domain name
and cPanel username where noted. In the user_prefs file, there's
a place where you need to enter your cpanel username.
